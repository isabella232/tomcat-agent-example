This is an example project for adding the Rollbar JVM agent to a Java project.

It assumes that the `librollbar_jvm_agent.so` file was obtained from elsewhere and placed within
this directory. Then the makefile takes care of the rest assuming you have a working Java
installation to handle the compilation.
